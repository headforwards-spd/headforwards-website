title: Can Agile work in local authorities?
introduction:

    The annual Agile on the Beach conference, co-founded by one of Headforwards’
    founders, Toby Parkins is now one of the most respected agile conferences in
    the UK with a growing international audience. It’s an opportunity for Agile
    practitioners to come together to hear from some of the leading voices in
    Agile and best practice, but it’s also a great place for people to get to
    understand the principals of an Agile methodology. For our local authority,
    Agile on the Beach sparked the question, “How could we become more Agile?”

          Cornwall Council turned to Headforwards with this question. The IT
          team had developed a project called Turning the tanker, the name
          itself demonstrating they were under no illusions as to the scale of
          the challenge they were undertaking. The IT team were working on a
          list of 70 projects, running simultaneously. They were struggling to
          move the entire council workforce onto a new operating system and they
          were planning to undertake a digital transformation of all their data.
          The challenge for the leadership was significant and they were
          prepared to change approach and adopt an Agile methodology if it could
          help them move things forward.

          In local authority, public sector and even some commercial
          organisations, I’ve seen occasions where IT teams require a mandate to
          get projects started. By the time it’s signed by all the relevant
          people, the budget has been queried, refined and resubmitted, four
          months or more have gone by and nothing has happened.  Local
          authorities generally have fixed budgets with projects requiring
          clearly defined outcomes and Agile, wrongfully, has a reputation for
          lacking rules. The conversation between us and the council wasn’t to
          force anything, we just encouraged them to start off by giving it a
          try, see how it felt and review whether it was working.   The
          advantage of Agile for local authorities is that you can start
          producing software right away. With so many projects running, our
          starting point was to cut through the noise and identify projects that
          would add value quickly and that we could get moving on. In this case,
          a new CXP for the HR department. We didn’t waste time creating an
          infrastructure, developing gantt charts and deciding what the final
          project would look like, we just starting building.   Within a week
          the HR team had something to look at, they had something to feed back
          to us on and within 6 months we had delivered two apps which they
          could embed into their process right away. They have something of
          value really quickly and now we’re building the backbone into it and
          adding additional features.

          The Coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on a lot of companies, but
          the need for the council to respond quickly is enormous. As well as
          their responsibility to support individuals, communities and
          businesses, the council has XX employees of its own who, within a
          matter of days all had to move from offices to home working.   The
          digital transformation focused on the vast quantities of data the
          council stores, but once the Coronavirus outbreak hit the urgent task
          became establishing and supporting homeworking. They needed to know
          who was working where and what they were doing and suddenly the data
          had to wait. Because Headforwards is an Agile organisation we were
          able to change our focus really quickly and redeploy our support
          resources where they were needed.

          From the little seed planted at Agile on the Beach, Cornwall Council
          have gone through some impressive change.   They’ve restructured their
          IT Team and have evolved from a project to a product based approach
          (need more details on exactly what this means) and using Agile to
          deliver results. Headforwards is supporting with a number of
          development projects and we’re continuing to help them bed into an
          Agile methodology, encompassing and accommodating issues within the
          plan rather than wasting time trying to work around them.   Agile
          really can help local authorities deliver value and make the difficult
          changes to how they manage their data in the future. But there’s no
          use trying to drive the tanker as you would a speedboat.
