          An entire dev team, gathered around one computer, all working on the
          same client project. It sounds like chaos, but it’s a brilliant way of
          delivering high quality software, fast. 


          Mob programming is used a lot at Headforwards. It’s a chance to apply
          a whole team’s ideas and knowledge to one project – and because they
          test as they go, any bugs can be instantly squashed.

      Mobbing keeps everyone on the same page. Everyone agrees how the software
      will be coded, issues are picked up on fast, and we’re quicker to spot
      potential traps in the process.

          Mobbing gets even better when clients are involved, whether they’re
          visiting Headforwards in person, or videoconferencing in from their
          site. 


          The whole team comes to know each other, and everyone feels aligned
          and motivated to deliver a great product. It all makes for a strong
          working partnership – something Headforwards strives to build with
          every client.

          Most of our mobs include developers from the client’s end. It’s much
          easier to collaborate and solve problems as they appear.

          But once a team tries mobbing, they often find they really enjoy
          working in such a collaborative way. Everyone at Headforwards has a
          specialist skill – whether it’s front-end development, database coding
          or web services – and mobbing means that knowledge gets shared.


          It’s a win-win: the client gets great quality software fast, and the
          devs and testers enjoy working together to create something of real
          value.

      There’s a great social side to mobbing – it helps you learn about your
      team as people. And in the long run, it helps us grow as developers to
      produce better software, more quickly, with fewer issues.
