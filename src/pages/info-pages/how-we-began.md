          conversation at a barbecue. Agile practitioner Toby Parkins was
          talking with a product owner from a global corporation, when the
          discussion turned to the difficulty of getting really good outsource
          developers.\r


          “He was talking about how you never get the right people,
          and how outsource companies just pull anyone off the bench to work on
          a project,” says Toby.\ 


          “I knew instantly that I could put together a brilliant team
          for him – and the whole concept of Headforwards was founded in that
          moment.”"

          They agreed that clients were short-changed by traditional
          outsourcers, who tend to prioritise their own business over that of

  - quote: It’s about picking the right people for each client, rather than running
      a bench. It may be slightly less efficient for us, but the client gets
      much better quality and value – and that’s what matters.

    title: The right people
  - quote: We wanted to create teams that would be with the client for the
      long-term, so their knowledge could build up and be shared and retained.

    title: Dedicated teams
  - quote: We wanted to involve clients in picking their teams, and to be
      transparent with them about our cost model. It makes for a much more
      productive and trusting relationship.

          As clients increasingly look for outsource companies that
          deliver long-term value and competitive differentiation, Headforwards
          stands in good stead for the future."
