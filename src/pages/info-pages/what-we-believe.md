          Headforwards believes clients get the greatest business value from
          software outsourcing when development teams are empowered to make
          their own decisions.


          Clients look to Headforwards to develop software that creates value
          but, in a rapidly changing business environment, what constitutes that
          value might change from one week to the next.


          Software can only continue to deliver business value if the
          development teams can adapt quickly and smoothly to changing client
          needs. A client relationship based on trust, transparency and
          collaboration combined with Agile working practices allows
          Headforwards to be able to respond to changes in a constructive way.

          If something changes in our client’s world, they've got to adapt,
          they've got to look for a new competitive advantage in their software
          and that’s always what we aim to deliver.

          The Agile Manifesto says quality software emerges from self-organising
          teams. Decision-making responsibility lies with the team working on
          each client project.


          When team members feel empowered and engaged, they work to their full
          potential, and it shows in the quality of the software they deliver.

          We believe the team is greater than the sum of its parts. We want to
          empower everybody who works for us and maximise their contribution –
          and the client really benefits from that.
