          people-centric rather than process-orientated, placing a strong focus
          on finding the right people and helping them develop their skills. \r


          For a team to do great work, it needs great coaching and
          strong, supportive relationships. These relationships are at the heart
          of everything Headforwards does, and play a big part in the great
          service the company offers to its clients."

    quote: It’s important to get teams working together to be the best they can be.
      This can only happen if your people gel and build their own relationships
      before building one with a client.

          Right from the off, both Headforwards teams and clients are included
          on instant messaging channels and deployment systems.\r


          This creates complete transparency – so clients not only see
          what work is being done, they can react to it immediately with their
          thoughts and feedback."

    quote: Everyone in my team is equal, and they each bring important skills and
      knowledge to the table. In my role as a Scrum Master, I work with
      influence and competency, rather than authority and seniority.

      - text: "Headforwards builds its teams based on each job’s specific needs. That’s
          why an initial workshop with the client at the start of the
          relationship is key. \r


          It’s an opportunity for clients to establish their exact
          requirements, so the team at Headforwards can estimate the project’s
          scope, and even make a start the very same day."

  - quote: Our people are so much more than developers. Yes, they design and build,
      but they also test, deploy, and provide on-going support. It means they’re
      responsible and accountable for the full project lifecycle.
