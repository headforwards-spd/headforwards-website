            The annual Agile on the Beach conference, co-founded by one of Headforwards’
            founders, Toby Parkins is now one of the most respected agile conferences in
            the UK with a growing international audience. It’s an opportunity for Agile
            practitioners to come together to hear from some of the leading voices in
            Agile and best practice, but it’s also a great place for people to get to
            understand the principals of an Agile methodology. For our local authority,
            Agile on the Beach sparked the question, “How could we become more Agile?”

          [Cornwall Council](https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/) turned to
          Headforwards with this question. The IT team had developed a project
          called Turning the tanker, the name itself demonstrating they were
          under no illusions as to the scale of the challenge they were
          undertaking. The IT team were working on a list of 70 projects,
          running simultaneously. They were struggling to move the entire
          council workforce onto a new operating system and they were planning
          to undertake a digital transformation of all their data. The challenge
          for the leadership was significant and they were prepared to change
          approach and adopt an [Agile
          methodology](/what-we-do/create-value-through-software/) if it could
          help them move things forward.

          In local authority, public sector and even some commercial
          organisations, I’ve seen occasions where IT teams require a mandate to
          get projects started. By the time it’s signed by all the relevant
          people, the budget has been queried, refined and resubmitted, four
          months or more have gone by and nothing has happened.  Local
          authorities generally have fixed budgets with projects requiring
          clearly defined outcomes and Agile, wrongfully, has a reputation for
          lacking rules. The conversation between us and the council wasn’t to
          force anything, we just encouraged them to start off by giving it a
          try, see how it felt and review whether it was working.   The
          advantage of Agile for local authorities is that you can start
          producing software right away. With so many projects running, our
          starting point was to cut through the noise and identify projects that
          would add value quickly and that we could get moving on. In this case,
          a new CXP for the HR department. We didn’t waste time creating an
          infrastructure, developing gantt charts and deciding what the final
          project would look like, we just starting building.   Within a week
          the HR team had something to look at, they had something to feed back
          to us on and within 6 months we had delivered two apps which they
          could embed into their process right away. They have something of
          value really quickly and now we’re building the backbone into it and
          adding additional features.

          The Coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on a lot of companies, but
          the need for the council to respond quickly is enormous. As well as
          their responsibility to support individuals, communities and
          businesses, the council has many employees of its own who, within a
          matter of days all had to move from offices to home working.   The
          digital transformation focused on the vast quantities of data the
          council stores, but once the Coronavirus outbreak hit the urgent task
          became establishing and supporting homeworking. They needed to know
          who was working where and what they were doing and suddenly the data
          had to wait. Because Headforwards is an Agile organisation we were
          able to change our focus really quickly and redeploy our support
          resources where they were needed.

          From the little seed planted at [Agile on the
          Beach](https://agileonthebeach.com/), Cornwall Council have gone
          through some impressive change.   They’ve restructured their IT Team
          and have evolved from a project to a product based approach (need more
          details on exactly what this means) and using Agile to deliver
          results. Headforwards is supporting with a number of development
          projects and we’re continuing to help them bed into an Agile
          methodology, encompassing and accommodating issues within the plan
          rather than wasting time trying to work around them.   Agile really
          can help local authorities deliver value and make the difficult
          changes to how they manage their data in the future. But there’s no
          use trying to drive the tanker as you would a speedboat.
