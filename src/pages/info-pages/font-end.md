          We build scalable, rich user interfaces that we are very proud of.


          We hire people who are experienced with JavaScript frameworks such as React/Backbone.js, but we also understand that some people haven’t yet used these frameworks but can bring valuable insight. If you are willing to learn then we’d love to hear from you.


          Our front end teams all have a solid understanding of fundamental web technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript – as you’d expect. We use Git or similar for version control.


          We are all on a DevOps journey. Generally we like to understand and have an interest in the machine that the software sits on. If you are interested in Continuous Delivery and bleeding the edges of your experience then you will fit in well here. We are working with some pretty exciting technologies, which we don’t expect you to have experience of however if you do, it would be a bonus. For exampleDocker, Kafka and Jenkins.


          Our people are smart, multi-cultural and real team players. Which means you can keep learning, taking up new challenges and really stretching yourself. All in a team-first environment, where there are no egos or political games. Just great people doing great work. So you can focus on what you do best –tackling real challenges head-on.
