          When it comes to talent development, we don’t rely on traditional
          training programs. Instead, we’ve created an open, knowledge-sharing
          culture where those eager to progress can learn from some of the best
          in the business—and share their own experiences in turn.


          For the curious, dedicated and determined, this presents the perfect opportunity to advance their skills and discover where their ability can take them.

          An appetite for learning is a key characteristic of our people. If you
          are self-motivated, you’ll fit in well and you will find ample
          opportunities to learn from some fantastic people.  


          As well as our emphasis on knowledge sharing, we organise event visits, courses and expert-led talks to help our people stay up to date with the latest industry developments. Mini workshops also provide regular opportunities to exchange ideas, learn from each other and practice important skills like public speaking.

      - text: Self-directed learning is great, but it’s also important that people know
          what opportunities are available. That’s why we developed a framework
          to help our employees identify potential career paths. Typical of our
          inclusive environment, Headforwards’ career progression framework was
          created together with the whole team, so everyone has input into their
          own development.
