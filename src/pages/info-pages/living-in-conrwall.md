          If you’ve never been to Cornwall before, you are in for a treat. 


          The county is famed for its golden sands, great surf and rich history – from the tin mines dotted around the coast to King Arthur’s castle protecting the peninsula. Even the weather is unlike anywhere else in England, with a sub-tropical climate providing the mildest conditions in the UK, and some of the longest hours of sunlight.


          Say goodbye to frost and snow (most of the time, anyway), and say hello to palm trees and pasties.

          Those of you who’ve visited Cornwall during the holiday season will
          know it as a bustling slice of paradise – but it isn’t always like
          that. Living here means you get to experience Cornwall out of season,
          too, when the county takes on a different character.  The good news
          is, it’s just as great as it is in the summer (and it’s slightly
          quicker to get around). 


          If you crave the hustle and bustle of big city life, then Cornwall might not be for you. But other than that, there’s something for everyone. For nightlife and bars you have Truro, Newquay and Falmouth, and if you’re seeking a quiet life by the coast there are no end of historic villages to choose from.

          Our unique location means we have all sorts going on that you won’t
          find in the rest of the UK. For instance, our airport at Newquay is
          now the home of UK space travel, with test flights of Virgin Orbit
          happening now. 


          We’re also home to Goonhilly Earth Station, whose mission is "to create the UK’s space communications gateway.”

          trying to get to the next meeting or staying late to finish projects.
          We’re working with global clients on cutting-edge projects, but not at
          the expense of our work-life balance. It’s something we really believe
          in: finish work on time, go home, take the dog for a walk, spend time
          with friends and family, go to the beach. Relax!"

          Despite what you may read or see on TV, living here is not as
          expensive as some people think.


          If you want a detached house right on the beach, it will cost you more, but it’s not equivalent to London prices at all. And there are plenty of coastal villages which are much cheaper to buy or rent in. In fact, living here is a lot cheaper than many UK cities. People often relocate from London and sometimes take a small pay cut, but their rent or mortgages are often halved.
