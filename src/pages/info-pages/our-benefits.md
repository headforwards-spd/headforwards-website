          When we wanted to improve our benefits offering, the first thing we
          did was to speak to our staff. We got some great feedback on what
          people appreciated and what they felt we could do better. 


          We’ve since given people five days more annual leave, a salary sacrifice car leasing scheme and a medical cashback plan. 


          And that’s just the start – we’re constantly looking to improve our offerings to staff to make sure they’re as happy as possible.

          Employee wellbeing is always hot on our agenda. That’s why so much
          effort is put into organising social and community-orientated
          activities that benefit people both inside and outside the
          organisation.


          Photos of our team are just as likely to show the founding partners cooking at a barbecue or someone raising a glass of ‘Devhops’ – one of our home-brew beers – as they are someone coding at their computer.


          The annual highlight of these events is Headstock, our very own mini-festival – a whole weekend in the summer where friends and family are invited to camp and eat great food in the heart of the Cornish countryside.
