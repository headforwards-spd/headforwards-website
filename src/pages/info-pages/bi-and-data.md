              We’re ensuring that people are able to access
              high-quality services through digital and technology channels. It’s an
              ambitious programme and one that we’re proud to be part of.It’s a
              high-profile project and it will play a big role in delivering key
              initiatives in Cornwall over the next few years. At the heart of the
              project is data. There are over 800 different data sources coming through
              in various different formats. We’re helping to understand and organise the
              data and make it available to the people who can use it to make a
              difference.      
        
        
              You will support the initial integration of identified data sets ranging
              from internal sources systems to external data feeds into a cloud based
              relational enterprise data warehouse. Working with the business to
              identify and produce management information from this centralised data
              store using a range of data visualisation tools. The delivery is primarily
              supported by a Microsoft first approach. Considerations must be given to
              the initiation, formation and standardisation of best practices to support
              ETL procedures, data quality measurement, data retention, master data
              management and role management.
