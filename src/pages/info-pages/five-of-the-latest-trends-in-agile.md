          It is now nearly two decades since the launch of The Agile Manifesto,
          yet Agile continues to grow in importance as it is embraced by more
          and more organisations.  


          For the very first time in 2020 the Project Management Institute (which is regarded as the global leader in project management training) [announced that it was introducing familiarity](https://www.pmi.org/learning/featured-topics/agile) with Agile concepts as part of the necessary skillset for their Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification – a reminder of the extent to which Agile is now at the heart of mainstream project management thinking. 


          Agile is here to stay – but Agile development continues to evolve as companies explore new and better ways of working.  


          Here are some of the current trends we are seeing in the industry, which will shape and define Agile into 2021 and beyond.


          ## 1. Scrum at Scale


          Extending Agile from individual Scrum teams to large scale programmes is gaining traction. 


          Scrum, as defined in the Scrum Guide, was originally envisaged as a framework for developing and delivering products by a single team. Scrum is now increasingly being scaled across many high performance teams within an organisation and the Scrum at Scale organisation has been created to find effective ways of co-ordinating this new eco system of multiple teams. 


          We are now seeing new practices emerging which are designed for a scaled setting, such as the ‘Scrum of Scrums’ to understand collective progress and be responsive to any issues raised by individual teams; and a Scaled Daily Scrum (SDS) which people from participating teams attend. 


          The Scrum at Scale organisation has already published several white papers on applying the [Scrum@Scale](https://www.scrumatscale.com/scrum-at-scale-guide/) model to improve efficiency and momentum will continue as this organisation and others explore the best ways of implementing scrum at scale.


          ## 2. Agile is being rolled out across organisations


          We are now seeing Agile principles rolled out beyond software development to other functions of the company –Agile Human Resources, Agile Marketing, Agile Engineering and so on.  


          This trend can be seen across a number of frameworks and discussion this year. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe version 5.0) which was released in January 2020, includes the addition  “Business Agility” for the first time. SAFe is one of the hottest things amongst large companies today and this upward trend is likely to continue. 


          The concept of Enterprise Agile will become increasingly mainstream, as the principles of constant feedback and rapid iteration are equally valid right across organisations. Agile is being increasingly sought as businesses seek to improve productivity and competitiveness.  


          Reflecting this trend, we are also seeing a growth in Agile Coaching. In contrast to Scrum Masters, who act as strategic coaches for their teams, Agile Coaches operate at organisational level, charged with implementing agile at scale and across organisations. Over the next decade, we are likely to see more enterprises setting up a centralised Agile team to oversee the implementation of agile.

          ## 3. Distributed Agile teams


          Agile was originally designed on the premise of co-located teams that can easily communicate with each other and respond quickly to change. The rise in working from home (rapidly accelerated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic) means that many teams are now working remotely. This is creating fresh challenges as the newly distributed teams need to invent new ways of achieving the same quality of close communication and responsiveness as a co-located team.  


          At the same time, global outsourcing continues to grow apace and again this can in some cases mean teams are virtual. Although co-location is seen as the best practice, many Agile teams are now distributed. Technology is being used to overcome the challenges of physical distance and Agile management tools such as Storyteller are being used to track and monitor outsourcing activities, improving collaboration and ensuring alignment. 


          It is likely that in the post-pandemic world, Agile will continue to evolve in ways that transcend the need for co-location and finds new ways of optimising agile performance in distributed teams. 


          ## 4. AI and Machine Learning is boosting agility


          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now boosting our agility, speeding up processes and increasing efficiency. AI is being used to help Agile teams make smart decisions about their Agile practice, and Machine Learning is eradicating some predictable and monotonous tasks, freeing up staff to work on tasks that add more value. 


          With the emergence of AI and Machine Learning, the software development industry is undergoing transformation on an unprecedented scale, streamlining continuous testing for faster releases and accelerated delivery.  This is turbo-charging the whole environment in which Agile operates. 


          ## 5. Greater management and tracking of business value


          There is an upward trend on managing and tracking the delivery of business value.  As Agile becomes increasingly embedded within organisations, there is a new emphasis on evaluating business value, so it can be optimised. We are seeing this happening through a number of different tools and techniques, including value stream management (VSM), and metric/results tracking tools such as [Pluralsight Flow](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow). Teams which adopt these approaches to manage and track business value will be able to make data-driven decisions and prioritisations. These new tools can provide the deeper insights that enable teams to continue to improve and deliver greater value to stakeholders. 


          For Headforwards, as one of the first pioneers in Agile in the UK, this is an exciting time. As Agile grows worldwide through scaling frameworks and whole-organisation transformations, we are looking forward to staying at the cutting edge of Agile and continuing to innovate.
